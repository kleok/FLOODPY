    description = "The FLOOD  PYthon toolbox is a free and open-source python toolbox for mapping of floodwater. It exploits the dense Sentinel-1 GRD intensity time series and is based on four processing steps. In the first step, a selection of Sentinel-1 images related to pre-flood (baseline) state and flood state is performed. In the second step, the preprocessing of the selected images is performed in order to create a co-registered stack with all the pre-flood and flood images. In the third step, a statistical temporal analysis is performed and a t-score map that represents the changes due to flood event is calculated. Finally, in the fourth step, a multi-scale iterative thresholding algorithm based on t-score map is performed to extract the final flood map. We believe that the end-user community can benefit by exploiting the FLOMPY's floodwater maps.",
