#   B. Flood event temporal information  
#-------------------------------------------------------------
# Your have to provide the datetime of your flood event. Make sure that
# a flood event took place at your provided datetime. 
# Based on your knowledge you can change [before_flood_days] in order
# to create a biggest 
# Sentinel-1 image that is going to be used to extract flood information
# will be between Flood_datetime and Flood_datetime+after_flood_days
# the closest Sentinel-1 to the Flood_datetime is picked

#  C. Flood event spatial information 
#-------------------------------------------------------------
# You can provide AOI VECTOR FILE or AOI BBOX. 
# Please ensure that your AOI BBOX has dimensions smaller than 100km x 100km
# If you provide AOI VECTOR, AOI BBOX parameters will be ommited

#  D. Precipitation information   
#-------------------------------------------------------------
#  Based on your knowledge, provide information related to the 
# accumulated precipitation that is required in order a flooding to occur. 
# These particular values will be used to classify Sentinel-1 images
#  which images correspond to flood and non-flood conditions.
